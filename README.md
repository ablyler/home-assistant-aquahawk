### Manual installation
1. Update Home Assistant to version 2021.12 or newer.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Copy the `custom_components/aquahawk` folder into your Home Assistant's `custom_components` folder.

### Configuring
1. Add `AquaHawk` integration via UI.
2. Enter AquaHawk cloud hostname, account id, username, and password.
3. The integration will discover appliance on local network(s).
4. If an appliance is not automatically discovered, but is registered to the cloud account, user is prompted to enter IPv4 address of the appliance.
5. If you want to use integration with air conditioner unit(s), please select the checkbox on `Advanced settings` page.

## Known issues

* Sensor values are delayed due to the infrequent sending of data from the water meters to the cloud. The delay is usually many hours to a day in my experience.

## Supported entities

This custom component creates following entities for each discovered dehumidifier:

Platform | Description
-- | --
`sensor` | Sensor for water usage today.
`sensor` | Sensor for water usage this year.

## Energy dashboard

This integration supports energy dashboard. To enable it, go to `Settings -> Dashboards -> Energy`, click on `Add Water Source`, and select `AquaHawk Yearly`. Once added, you can see water usage in the energy dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

If there are problems while using integration setup, an advanced debug logging can be activated via `Advanced settings` page.

Once activated, logs can be see by clicking at:

Select `Load Full Home Assistant Log` to see all debug mode logs. Please include as much logs as possible if you open an [issue](https://github.com/ablyler/home-assistant-aquahawk/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=issue.md).

[![Home Assistant Logs][ha-logs-badge]][ha-logs]

Debug logging can be activated without going through setup process:

[![Logging service][ha-service-badge]][ha-service]

On entry page, paste following content:

```yaml
service: logger.set_level
data:
    custom_components.aquahawk: DEBUG
```

It is possible to activate debug logging on Home Assistent start. To do this, open Home Assistant's `configuration.yaml` file on your machine, and add following to `logger` configuration:

```yaml
logger:
  # Begging of lines to add
  logs:
    custom_components.aquahawk: debug
  # End of lines to add
```

Home Assistant needs to be restarted after this change.
